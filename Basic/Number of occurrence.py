Given a sorted array A of size N and a number X, you need to find the number of occurrences of X in A.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input: The first line contains N and X(element whose occurrence needs to be counted). The second line contains the elements of the array separated by spaces.

Output:
For each testcase, print the count of the occurrences of X in the array, if count is zero then print -1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 103
1 <= X <= 103

Example:
Input:
2
7 2
1 1 2 2 2 2 3
7 4
1 1 2 2 2 2 3
Output:
4
-1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 2 occurs 4 times in 1 1 2 2 2 2 3
Testcase 2: 4 is not present in 1 1 2 2 2 2 3

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    n , x  = input().split()
    
    A = list(map(int , input().split()))
    
    count = 0
    
    x = int(x)
    
    for i in A:
        if (x == i):
            count +=  1
        
    if x not in A:
            count = -1
            
    print(count)
