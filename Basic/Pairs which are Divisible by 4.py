'''
Given an array if â€˜nâ€™ positive integers, count number of pairs of integers in the array that have the sum divisible by 4.

Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case follows. Each test-case has two lines of the input, the first line contains an integer denoting the size of an array N and the second line of input contains N positive integers.
Output:

Print the number of pairs of integers in the array that have the sum divisible by 4.
Constraints:

1<=T<=100

1<=N<=100

1<=arr[]<=1000
Example:

Input:

2

5

2 2 1 7 5

5

2 2 3 5 6

Output:

3

4

Explanation:

Testcase 1: (2,2), (1,7) and(7,5) are the 3 pairs.

Testcase 2: (2,2), (2,6), (2,6), (3,5) are the 4 pairs.
